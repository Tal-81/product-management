## Project Overview

🌟 Local Product Management System Features
This system offers an integrated and efficient interface for product management, prioritizing local performance and independence.

💾 Core Feature: Local Data Persistence in local browser
The system is uniquely capable of saving all product data locally without requiring a connection to a remote server or external database. This ensures faster access and complete operational autonomy.

🧮 Financial Calculation and Pricing
Automated Price Calculation: The system efficiently handles essential financial calculations. It automatically calculates the product tax and discount based on the base price, and accurately displays the final total price.

📝 Data Management and Navigation
Comprehensive Data Control (CRUD): The system provides full functionality for the four fundamental data management operations:

Add: Inserting new products into the inventory.

Read: Displaying and retrieving product details.

Update: Modifying details of existing products.

Delete: Removing one or more products from the system.

Simple Pagination: The product table is displayed using a simple pagination mechanism, showing only 5 products per page for streamlined viewing and easier data handling.

## Responsive Design
*  It features a responsive design optimized for various devices.
* The interface ensures a seamless experience across all screen sizes and devices.
* The application provides a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## User Experience
### Goals

Primary Goals of the Product Management System
The primary goal of designing this Product Management System is to deliver an effective, user-friendly, and locally-optimized platform dedicated to efficient product control and inventory monitoring.

💼 ***Functional and Operational Objectives***
* Comprehensive Data Control (CRUD): To empower users with the capability to perform all essential data management operations: Adding, Reading, Updating, and Deleting products, individually or in batches.

* Operational Autonomy: To ensure the system’s ability to save and process data locally (via Local Storage), guaranteeing speed and reliability without dependency on external servers or constant internet connectivity.

* Accurate Financial Calculations: To provide integrated calculation tools that accurately and instantly determine taxes and discounts, and clearly display the final total price.

* Responsive Design: To build a fully responsive user interface that adapts seamlessly and provides an optimal user experience across all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

🚀 ***User Experience and Performance Goals***
* Simplified Navigation: To manage large datasets effectively by employing pagination, displaying a limited number of products per page to streamline viewing and data review.

* Clarity and Efficiency: To offer an intuitive and clean user interface that allows users to complete tasks quickly with minimal steps, enhancing overall workflow efficiency.

### Target Group
* Small Business Owners / Solo Entrepreneurs: Individuals who need a simple, cost-effective tool to track a limited inventory or service list without subscribing to complex cloud-based SaaS solutions.

* Retail Managers (Local Scale): Personnel responsible for managing stock levels, setting prices, and applying discounts for a small, single-location business (e.g., boutique stores, small cafes, local workshops).

* Data Entry Specialists / Admins: Users whose primary responsibility is performing routine CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to maintain accurate product records quickly and efficiently.

* Budget-Conscious Users: Individuals seeking a powerful, responsive tool that provides financial calculations (tax/discount) and data structuring without requiring a dedicated IT infrastructure or remote hosting.

* Developers / Students (for educational use): Users interested in a clean, functional application to inspect and learn about front-end CRUD logic and local data persistence via the browser. 

---

### User Goals
The primary goals for users interacting with the Product Management System are focused on efficient data handling and smooth functionality:

* Efficient Data Management (CRUD): Quickly and easily Add, Read, Update, and Delete product records to keep the inventory current and accurate.

* Rapid Financial Calculation: Input product details and instantly view the calculated tax, discount, and final total price without the need for external tools.

* Seamless Local Operation: Manage and save product data directly within the browser (Local Storage), ensuring reliability and speed even without an active internet connection.

* Simplified Navigation: Effortlessly browse through the product list using pagination to manage and locate items in large datasets.

* Intuitive and Responsive Experience: Utilize a clean, modern interface that provides a consistent and smooth experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

### Business Goals
The business goals for developing and maintaining this Local Product Management System are centred on providing maximum utility and efficiency for small-scale operations:

* Enhance Data Efficiency: Provide a fast, reliable tool that significantly reduces the time and effort required for routine product data entry and maintenance (CRUD operations).

* Increase Operational Autonomy: Offer a solution that ensures business continuity by operating entirely on local storage, minimizing reliance on external servers and potential hosting costs.

* Promote Accuracy in Pricing: Ensure precise financial calculations (tax and discount) are consistently applied, reducing pricing errors and increasing confidence in total cost figures.

* Maximize User Adoption: Deliver a highly intuitive and responsive user experience (UX) to ensure quick adoption by staff and minimal training requirements.

* Establish Reliability and Trust: Build a reputation for delivering a stable, functional, and consistent application across all supported devices, reinforcing its credibility as a dependable management tool.

### Bugs & Fixes
1.    aria-discribedby html attribute found in input html element write by bootstrap but I did not let this attribute pointo other html element by id attribute :
![aria describedby attribute issue must point to an element in the same document](assets/images/aria-describedby-issue-1.png)
        * add id in other html element and this id must has name like aria-describedby.
![fixed by add id to an html element and that id pointed by describedby attribute](assets/images/aria-describedby-fix-1.png)
2.    function (pagination) cannot call (btnPage) number pages in pagination bar the reason is the buttons create after DOM created, the buttons number pages create dynamically by javascript for that they create after Dom:
![buttons group are not active on global scope because they are not created before DOM](assets/images/elements-created-after-Dom-issue.png)
        * Move definition of btnPage from global scope to inside function pagination that needs that variable.
![fixed that by moving definition of buttons from global scope to function scope](assets/images/elements-created-after-Dom-fixed.png)
3.    The issue is semicoln missing on line 419 that message displaying by Javascript validator and it fixed by adding semicoln to the end of this line:
![Line 419 missing Semicolen missing](assets/images/issue-semicolen-missing-on-line-419.png)
4.    Pagination buttons is runing not I expected when I click on button number 3 must it bring items that placed in indexs(6,7,8) in the products array but It bring items in indexs(0,1,2) that was issue  :
![Pagination system is runing not I expected](assets/images/pagination-1.png)
        * I followed this process by inspector tool that found in google chrome and I fixed this issue by rewriting the mathematical equation that appropriate this process.
![follow error by inspector in developer tools in google chrome](assets/images/pagination-2.png)
![follow error by inspector in developer tools in google chrome](assets/images/pagination-3.png)
![all the code is correct just changed mathematical equation that appropriate this process](assets/images/pagination-4.png)
